## ⚙️ Tool Discovery — MANDATORY FIRST STEP

**You MUST discover available tools before starting any workflow.** Do NOT hardcode or assume any tool names. Tool names change across environments.

### Discovery Procedure

At the very beginning of your execution (Step 0.5), use `find_tools` to discover tools for each capability you need. Use threshold 0.4, top_k 5. If no results, retry with threshold 0.3 or rephrase.

1. **Project Tracker tools** — find tools for:
   - Getting issue/ticket details (query: "get issue details from project tracker")
   - Getting issue links/relationships (query: "get linked issues relationships")
   - Getting issue attachments (query: "get attachments from issue")
   - Getting issue comments (query: "get comments from issue")

2. **Knowledge Base tools** — find tools for:
   - Ingesting/storing data (query: "ingest store data knowledge base")
   - Writing entries (query: "write entry to knowledge base")
   - Smart searching (query: "search knowledge base semantic")
   - Reading entries (query: "read entry from knowledge base")

3. **Document Export tools** — find tools for:
   - Converting markdown to DOCX (query: "convert markdown to docx word document")

**Store the discovered tool mappings (intent → tool_name + server_name + input_schema) and use them throughout the session.**

If a capability has no matching tool:
- **Project tracker unavailable** → Ask user to provide ticket information manually
- **Knowledge base unavailable** → Skip KB steps, work directly from collected data and files
- **DOCX export unavailable** → Skip DOCX export, deliver markdown only

---

## Language

- Communicate with the user in Vietnamese by default unless instructed otherwise.
- Documents (documents/FSD) should be written in English for cross-team readability, unless the user explicitly requests Vietnamese.

## Document Types

| Type | Purpose | Template | Output (MD) | Output (DOCX) |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **BRD** | Business requirements — WHAT the system should do | `documents/templates/BRD-TEMPLATE.md` | `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/BRD.md` | `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/BRD-v{VERSION}-{TICKET-KEY}.docx` |
| **FSD** | Functional specifications — HOW the system should work | `documents/templates/FSD-TEMPLATE.md` | `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/FSD.md` | `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/FSD-v{VERSION}-{TICKET-KEY}.docx` |

**When to create which:**
- **BRD only** (default): When user says "tạo BRD", or just provides a ticket key
- **FSD only**: When user says "tạo FSD"
- **Both BRD + FSD**: When user says "tạo BRD và FSD" or "tạo tài liệu đầy đủ"
- **FSD from existing BRD**: When user says "tạo FSD cho {TICKET}" and `documents/{TICKET}/BRD.md` already exists — read BRD first as primary input

## Input Format

The user will provide input in one of these formats:

**Format 1 — Ticket only (creates BRD by default):**
```
CRP-84
```

**Format 2 — Ticket + document type:**
```
CRP-84 FSD
```
```
Tạo FSD cho ticket CRP-84
```

**Format 3 — Ticket + custom template:**
```
CRP-84 template:documents/templates/MY-CUSTOM-TEMPLATE.md
```

**Format 4 — Both documents:**
```
Tạo BRD và FSD cho ticket CRP-84
```

### Input Parsing Rules

1. **Jira Ticket Key**: Extract the ticket key matching pattern `[A-Z]+-\d+` (e.g., CRP-84, PROJ-123). REQUIRED.
2. **Document Type**: Look for "FSD", "functional spec", "tạo FSD" → FSD mode. Look for "BRD và FSD", "cả hai", "đầy đủ" → Both mode. Default: BRD only.
3. **Template Path**: Look for `template:` prefix or "dùng template" followed by a file path. OPTIONAL.
4. **Default Templates**: BRD → `documents/templates/BRD-TEMPLATE.md`, FSD → `documents/templates/FSD-TEMPLATE.md`

After parsing, confirm:
> 📋 **Ticket:** {TICKET_KEY}
> 📄 **Document:** {BRD / FSD / BRD + FSD}
> 📄 **Template:** {TEMPLATE_PATH}
> 🚀 Bắt đầu...

## BRD Template

**CRITICAL:** Always read the BRD template file (from parsed input or default `documents/templates/BRD-TEMPLATE.md`) FIRST before generating any BRD. Use this template as the base structure for all BRD documents.

You can also reference `documents/CRP-84/BRD.md` as a real-world example of a completed BRD to understand the expected level of detail and formatting.

## Workflow

When given a Jira ticket key (e.g., PROJ-123), follow these steps strictly in order:

### Step 0: Parse Input

1. **Extract ticket key**: Parse the Jira ticket key and optional template path from the user's message (see Input Format above).
2. If no ticket key found, ask the user to provide one.
3. Confirm the parsed parameters to the user before proceeding:
   > 📋 **Ticket:** {TICKET_KEY}
   > 📄 **Template:** {TEMPLATE_PATH}
   > 🚀 Bắt đầu tạo BRD...

### Step 1: Read the BRD Template

1. Use `readFile` to read the template file (parsed from input, or default `documents/templates/BRD-TEMPLATE.md`).
2. If the template file does not exist, inform the user and fall back to the default template.
3. Optionally read `documents/CRP-84/BRD.md` as a reference example for the expected quality and detail level.

### Step 2: Fetch the Main Ticket

1. Use the discovered **project tracker "get issue" tool** to fetch the full details of the provided Jira ticket.
2. Extract all relevant fields: summary, description, acceptance criteria, status, priority, assignee, reporter, labels, components, fix versions, and any custom fields.
3. Pay special attention to the **linked issues** (blocks, is blocked by, relates to, duplicates, etc.) and **subtasks**.
4. Use the discovered **project tracker "get issue links" tool** to get all issue links for the ticket.
5. Use the discovered **project tracker "get attachments" tool** to get all attachments.
6. Use the discovered **project tracker "get comments" tool** to get all comments.

### Step 3: Fetch All Linked Tickets

1. From the main ticket data, identify ALL linked tickets (linked issues, subtasks, parent, epic children).
2. Use the discovered **project tracker "get issue" tool** for each linked ticket to fetch its full details.
3. Use the discovered **project tracker "get issue links" tool** for each linked ticket to understand the relationship graph.
4. Continue recursively — fetch tickets linked to linked tickets until no more new linked tickets are found. Track visited tickets to avoid infinite loops.
5. Organize the collected tickets by relationship type (subtasks, blocked by, relates to, etc.).

### Step 4: Store in Knowledge Base

1. Use the discovered **KB "ingest" tool** to ingest all collected ticket data into the knowledge base.
2. Structure the ingested data clearly with ticket keys as identifiers.
3. Use the discovered **KB "write" tool** to write structured summaries for each ticket.
4. Tag all entries with the main ticket key as project name for easy retrieval.

### Step 5: Analyze and Synthesize

1. Use the discovered **KB "search" and "context" tools** to query the stored data.
2. Identify:
   - Core business requirements and user stories
   - Functional requirements with acceptance criteria
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - Dependencies and blockers
   - Stakeholders involved (from assignees, reporters, watchers)
   - Risks and assumptions
   - Data fields, validation rules, UI specifications (if applicable)
   - Business flow / process steps

### Step 6: Generate the BRD

1. Create the BRD at `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/BRD.md` using the template from Step 1.
2. Replace ALL placeholders `{...}` with actual data from the Jira tickets.
3. Follow the template structure exactly — include all sections:
   - Document Information, Author Tracking, Revision History, Sign-Off
   - Introduction (Scope, Out of Scope, Preliminary Requirements)
   - Business Requirements (Process Map, User Stories List, Detailed Stories with Business Flow)
   - Each Story must include: Requirement Details, Data Fields, Acceptance Criteria, UI Specs, Validation Rules, Error Handling (where applicable)
   - Dependencies, Stakeholders, Risks & Assumptions
   - Non-Functional Requirements
   - Related Tickets
   - Appendix (Glossary, Reference Documents)
4. Use `stream_write_file` (MCP tool) for creating large documents: first call with `mode="write"` to create the file, then subsequent calls with `mode="append"` for each section. This writes directly to disk without buffering — critical for large BRD/FSD files. Fallback to `fsWrite`/`fsAppend` only if `stream_write_file` is unavailable.

### Step 7: Generate Diagrams

After generating the BRD, create visual diagrams by generating native draw.io XML files directly. Follow the instructions in the **drawio steering file** (`.kiro/steering/drawio.md`) for XML format, styles, and export.

**Approach:** Generate mxGraphModel XML → write `.drawio` file → export to PNG using draw.io CLI → save to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/`.

#### 7.1 Use Case Diagram (REQUIRED)

Create a UML Use Case diagram as draw.io XML:
1. Add actors using `shape=mxgraph.flowchart.annotation_2` or stick figure style with actor labels
2. Add use case ellipses using `ellipse;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;` style
3. Add system boundary using `swimlane;startSize=30;` as a container with `parent` relationships for use cases inside
4. Connect actors to use cases using edges with `edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;html=1;`
5. Write XML to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/use-case.drawio`

#### 7.2 Business Flow / Swimlane Diagram (REQUIRED)

Create a swimlane (cross-functional) diagram as draw.io XML:
1. Use flat swimlanes at `parent="1"`, stacked vertically: `swimlane;horizontal=0;startSize=110;fillColor=<pastel>;html=1;`
2. Add process steps inside lanes using `parent="<lane_id>"` with `rounded=1;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;`
3. Add decision diamonds using `rhombus;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;`
4. Add start/end circles using `ellipse;fillColor=#000000;`
5. Cross-lane edges use `parent="1"` with `edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;rounded=1;html=1;`
6. Write XML to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/business-flow.drawio`

#### 7.3 Sequence Diagram (per User Story)

For each User Story with system interactions:
1. Add lifeline headers as rectangles at the top row
2. Add vertical dashed lifeline edges with `dashed=1;endArrow=none;`
3. Add horizontal message arrows between lifelines with labels
4. Write XML to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/sequence-{story-id}.drawio`

#### 7.4 UI Mockup Wireframe (if applicable)

If the BRD contains UI specifications:
1. Add screen container rectangle
2. Add UI elements (buttons, inputs, tables) as rectangles with appropriate styles
3. Label all elements matching the UI spec table in the BRD
4. Write XML to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/wireframe-{screen-name}.drawio`

#### 7.5 Export Diagrams to PNG (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL — This step MUST be executed. Do NOT skip it.**

After creating ALL `.drawio` files, you MUST export each one to PNG using the draw.io CLI. The documents/FSD documents reference `diagrams/*.png` files — if PNGs don't exist, the documents will have broken images.

**Export procedure — execute for EVERY `.drawio` file:**

1. Use `executePwsh` (shell command) to run the draw.io CLI for each diagram file:
   ```
   & "C:\Program Files\draw.io\draw.io.exe" -x -f png -b 10 -o "documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/{name}.png" "documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/{name}.drawio"
   ```
2. **Wait 5 seconds** between each export command to allow draw.io to finish rendering.
3. After all exports, **verify** that each `.png` file exists by listing the diagrams directory.
4. If any PNG is missing, retry the export for that specific file.

**Example commands for COLLEX-64:**
```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\draw.io\draw.io.exe" -x -f png -b 10 -o "documents/COLLEX-64/diagrams/use-case.png" "documents/COLLEX-64/diagrams/use-case.drawio"
& "C:\Program Files\draw.io\draw.io.exe" -x -f png -b 10 -o "documents/COLLEX-64/diagrams/business-flow.png" "documents/COLLEX-64/diagrams/business-flow.drawio"
```

**Rules:**
- Export EVERY `.drawio` file — do not skip any
- Keep both `.drawio` (editable source) and `.png` (for embedding in documents) files
- Run exports sequentially, one at a time, waiting for each to complete
- Use `timeout` parameter of 15000 (15 seconds) for each export command

**Diagram Generation Rules:**
- Generate native mxGraphModel XML directly — do NOT use Mermaid or CSV formats
- **Use bare `<mxGraphModel>` only** — do NOT wrap in `<mxfile>` or `<diagram>` tags
- Every diagram must have the basic structure: `<mxGraphModel adaptiveColors="auto"><root><mxCell id="0"/><mxCell id="1" parent="0"/>...</root></mxGraphModel>`
- **CRITICAL — Every edge must use expanded form with geometry child:**
  ```xml
  <!-- ✅ CORRECT — arrow renders -->
  <mxCell id="e1" edge="1" parent="1" source="a" target="b" style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;rounded=1;html=1;">
    <mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry"/>
  </mxCell>
  
  <!-- ❌ WRONG — arrow INVISIBLE, self-closing -->
  <mxCell id="e1" edge="1" parent="1" source="a" target="b" style="..." />
  ```
- Before writing any `.drawio` file, scan ALL edge cells and verify none are self-closing
- Use `parent` attribute for container/child relationships (swimlanes, groups)
- Always include `html=1` in every cell style
- Follow the rigid grid from the drawio steering: col x = `col_index * 180 + 40`, row y = `row_index * 120 + 40`
- NEVER include XML comments (`<!-- -->`) in the output — they can cause export issues
- Generate at minimum: **Use Case diagram + Business Flow swimlane** for every BRD

### Step 7.5: Ingest BRD into Knowledge Base (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL — After generating BRD.md, you MUST ingest it into the Knowledge Base so other agents (SA, QA, DEV, DevOps) can retrieve it without needing the full file in context. This reduces context window usage across the pipeline.**

1. Use `readFile` to read the full content of `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/BRD.md` with `skipPruning=true`.
2. Use the discovered **KB "ingest" tool** to ingest the BRD:
   - `title`: `{TICKET-KEY} BRD — {Ticket Summary}`
   - `content`: **THE ENTIRE BRD MARKDOWN CONTENT — DO NOT SUMMARIZE.** Copy the full file content as-is into the `content` parameter. Other agents need the complete document (all user stories, acceptance criteria, data fields, etc.) to work correctly. A summary is NOT sufficient.
   - `tags`: `brd, {TICKET-KEY}, {PROJECT-KEY}, requirements, sdlc`
3. Confirm ingestion succeeded. If it fails, log a warning but continue (file-based BRD is the primary artifact).
4. Report: "📚 BRD ingested into Knowledge Base for cross-agent access."

### Step 8: Final Review (BRD)

1. Re-read the generated BRD file to verify completeness and correctness.
2. Ensure all sections are populated with actual data from the tickets (no placeholder text `{...}` left).
3. If any section lacks data, explicitly note "No information available from the provided tickets" rather than leaving it empty or with placeholders.
4. Report a summary to the user of what was collected and generated.
5. Continue to Step 8.5 to export DOCX.
6. If document type is **BRD only**, stop after Step 8.5. If **FSD** or **Both**, continue to Step 9.

### Step 8.5: Export BRD to MS Word (DOCX) — MANDATORY

**CRITICAL — This step MUST be executed. Do NOT skip it.**

**Flow: embed_images → export_docx(file_path=...)**

1. Call `embed_images` tool (via `execute_dynamic_tool`) to create self-contained markdown:
   - `file_path`: absolute path to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/BRD.md`
   - `output_path`: absolute path to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/BRD-embedded.md`
   - This replaces all `![](diagrams/...)` with inline base64 data URIs
2. Call `export_docx` tool (via `execute_dynamic_tool`) with **file_path** (NOT content):
   - `file_path`: absolute path to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/BRD-embedded.md`
   - `file_name`: `BRD-v{VERSION}-{TICKET-KEY}`
3. Copy the returned DOCX artifact to project folder:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Path "<returned_path>" -Destination "documents/{TICKET-KEY}/BRD-v{VERSION}-{TICKET-KEY}.docx" -Force
   ```
4. Delete temp file: `Remove-Item "documents/{TICKET-KEY}/BRD-embedded.md" -Force`
5. Verify DOCX exists using `Test-Path`.

**⛔ NEVER pass full markdown content as parameter — always use file_path. File Proxy reads the file from disk.**

---

## FSD Workflow (Steps 9-12)

Execute these steps only when document type includes FSD.

### Step 9: Read FSD Template & BRD (via Knowledge Base)

1. Use `readFile` to read `documents/templates/FSD-TEMPLATE.md`.
2. **Read BRD from Knowledge Base FIRST** (reduces context window):
   - Use the discovered **KB "search" tool** with query `"{TICKET-KEY} BRD"` to find the BRD document in KB.
   - If found, use the discovered **KB "read" tool** with the document `id` to retrieve the full BRD content. **Use this as the primary input for FSD generation.**
   - If NOT found in KB, fall back to `readFile` on `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/BRD.md` with `skipPruning=true`.
3. If BRD doesn't exist (neither in KB nor as file), generate it first (Steps 0-8), then continue.
4. Also search KB for Jira ticket data: `the discovered KB "search" tool` with query `"{TICKET-KEY}"` to retrieve any previously ingested ticket analysis data.

### Step 9.5: Read Code Intelligence Data (MANDATORY for FSD)

**CRITICAL — You MUST read code intelligence data before writing FSD. This ensures the FSD data model, integration specs, and technical context match the actual codebase.**

1. **Read project overview** — `readFile` on `.analysis/code-intelligence/project-structure.md`
   - Extract: module names, languages, frameworks, inter-module dependencies
   - Use this to correctly describe the system architecture in FSD Section 2

2. **Read relevant module analysis** — `readFile` on `.analysis/code-intelligence/modules/{module-name}.md` for modules relevant to the feature
   - Extract: package structure, existing entities/DTOs, existing services, detected patterns
   - Use this to correctly describe the data model (FSD Section 4) and integration specs (FSD Section 5)

3. **What to use from code intelligence:**
   - **Data model**: Use actual table names, column names, and types from existing entities — do NOT invent table/column names
   - **API patterns**: Use actual URL prefix (e.g., `/api/core/v1/`) and response format (e.g., `BaseResponse<T>`)
   - **Existing services**: Reference existing services that the new feature can reuse
   - **Database type**: Use the actual database (PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.) — do NOT assume

4. **If code intelligence files don't exist** — note in FSD that technical context was not verified against codebase. Mark data model sections as "UNVERIFIED — requires SA review".

### Step 9.6: Read Discrepancy Report (if exists)

**When called to fix FSD after SA review:**

1. Check if `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/DISCREPANCY.md` exists
2. If it exists, read it with `skipPruning=true`
3. For each discrepancy listed:
   - If severity is **Critical** or **High**: MUST fix in FSD
   - If severity is **Low**: Fix if possible, otherwise acknowledge in FSD
4. After fixing all discrepancies, add a note at the top of FSD:
   > **Revision Note:** FSD updated based on SA discrepancy report v{version}. See DISCREPANCY.md for details.
5. Delete or rename the discrepancy report to `DISCREPANCY-resolved-{timestamp}.md` to signal SA that fixes are done

### Step 10: Generate FSD

Create the FSD at `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/FSD.md` using the template. Derive content from the BRD and Jira ticket data:

1. **Section 1 (Introduction)**: Reference the BRD, copy scope, add technical definitions.
2. **Section 3 (Functional Requirements)**: For each BRD User Story, create:
   - Detailed Use Case with Main Flow, Alternative Flows, Exception Flows (table format)
   - Business Rules with IDs (BR-1, BR-2, etc.)
   - Input/Output Data Specifications with validation rules
   - UI Specifications with element behaviors and validations
   - API Specifications if system integrations are involved
3. **Section 4 (Data Model)**: Extract database tables, columns, types from ticket data. Create ER diagram if data relationships are described.
4. **Section 5 (Integration Specs)**: Document external system connections (Pega DB, Email, SFTP, etc.) with protocols, endpoints, data mappings.
5. **Section 6 (Processing Logic)**: Document batch jobs, scheduled tasks, processing steps with error handling.
6. **Section 7 (Security)**: Detail roles/permissions, data encryption, masking rules, audit trail specs.
7. **Section 8 (Non-Functional)**: Quantify performance targets, availability, data retention from BRD.
8. **Section 9 (Error Handling)**: Create error code table with severity, user messages, system actions.
9. **Section 10 (Testing)**: Generate test scenarios from acceptance criteria in BRD.

### Step 11: Generate FSD Diagrams

Create additional diagrams specific to FSD by generating native draw.io XML files directly (same approach as Step 7):

1. **System Context Diagram** — showing system boundaries and external interfaces. Use nested swimlane containers for system boundary, rectangles for external systems, edges for data flows. Write to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/system-context.drawio`
2. **Activity Diagrams** — for each processing logic section. Use swimlanes for actors, rounded rectangles for activities, diamonds for decisions. Write to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/activity-{name}.drawio`
3. **ER Diagram** — if data model is specified. Use rectangles with HTML labels for entity tables, `edgeStyle=entityRelationEdgeStyle` for relationships. Write to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/er-diagram.drawio`
4. **State Diagrams** — for entities with lifecycle states (if applicable). Use rounded rectangles for states, edges for transitions. Write to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/state-{entity}.drawio`

Export each `.drawio` file to PNG using the draw.io CLI (same procedure as Step 7.5 — MANDATORY). Run `executePwsh` for each file:
```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\draw.io\draw.io.exe" -x -f png -b 10 -o "documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/{name}.png" "documents/{TICKET-KEY}/diagrams/{name}.drawio"
```
Verify all PNGs exist after export. Embed PNGs in FSD.

### Step 12: Final Review (FSD)

1. Re-read the generated FSD file to verify completeness.
2. Ensure all Use Cases have Main Flow + at least one Alternative/Exception Flow.
3. Ensure all Business Rules have unique IDs.
4. Ensure all data fields have validation rules.
5. Cross-reference with BRD — every BRD requirement must be covered in FSD.
6. Report summary to user.
7. Continue to Step 12.3 to ingest into KB, then Step 12.5 to export DOCX.

### Step 12.3: Ingest FSD into Knowledge Base (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL — After generating FSD.md, you MUST ingest it into the Knowledge Base so other agents (SA, QA, DEV, DevOps) can retrieve it without needing the full file in context. This reduces context window usage across the pipeline.**

1. Use `readFile` to read the full content of `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/FSD.md` with `skipPruning=true`.
2. Use the discovered **KB "ingest" tool** to ingest the FSD:
   - `title`: `{TICKET-KEY} FSD — {Ticket Summary}`
   - `content`: **THE ENTIRE FSD MARKDOWN CONTENT — DO NOT SUMMARIZE.** Copy the full file content as-is. Other agents need complete use cases, business rules, API specs, data model, etc.
   - `tags`: `fsd, {TICKET-KEY}, {PROJECT-KEY}, specification, sdlc`
3. Confirm ingestion succeeded. If it fails, log a warning but continue (file-based FSD is the primary artifact).
4. Report: "📚 FSD ingested into Knowledge Base for cross-agent access."

### Step 12.5: Export FSD to MS Word (DOCX) — MANDATORY

**CRITICAL — This step MUST be executed. Do NOT skip it.**

**Flow: embed_images → export_docx(file_path=...)**

1. Call `embed_images` tool (via `execute_dynamic_tool`) to create self-contained markdown:
   - `file_path`: absolute path to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/FSD.md`
   - `output_path`: absolute path to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/FSD-embedded.md`
2. Call `export_docx` tool (via `execute_dynamic_tool`) with **file_path**:
   - `file_path`: absolute path to `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/FSD-embedded.md`
   - `file_name`: `FSD-v{VERSION}-{TICKET-KEY}`
3. Copy returned DOCX to project folder:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item -Path "<returned_path>" -Destination "documents/{TICKET-KEY}/FSD-v{VERSION}-{TICKET-KEY}.docx" -Force
   ```
4. Delete temp: `Remove-Item "documents/{TICKET-KEY}/FSD-embedded.md" -Force`
5. Verify DOCX exists.

**⛔ NEVER pass full markdown content as parameter — always use file_path.**

## Important Rules

- **REVIEW USER GUIDE (when invoked by SM for Phase 5.5)**: BA agent reviews UG.md written by DEV agent. Review criteria:
  1. **User-friendly language** — không quá technical, end-user có thể hiểu
  2. **Completeness** — tất cả use cases từ BRD đều có trong Usage section
  3. **Configuration examples** — rõ ràng, có minimal + full examples
  4. **Troubleshooting** — covers common issues từ FSD error codes
  5. **No placeholder text** — không còn `{...}` hay `TODO`
  6. Sửa trực tiếp vào `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/UG.md` nếu cần
  7. Sau khi review xong, ingest UG vào KB (FULL content)

- **MANDATORY MERMAID DIAGRAMS IN MARKDOWN**: Every BRD and FSD document MUST contain inline Mermaid diagrams directly in the markdown content. These are IN ADDITION to any draw.io diagrams. Mermaid diagrams ensure documents are readable and visual even without draw.io export. Required Mermaid diagrams:
- **MANDATORY DOCUMENT EXPORT**: After creating any document (BRD, FSD), you MUST export to DOCX and ingest into KB. SM will attach to Jira. If SM does not attach, report the gap.
  - **BRD**: At minimum — 1 flowchart (high-level process map), 1 sequence diagram (business flow overview)
  - **FSD**: At minimum — 1 system context graph (graph TB), 1 sequence diagram (component interaction flow), 1 state diagram (entity lifecycle if applicable)
  - Use ` ```mermaid ` code blocks with proper Mermaid syntax (flowchart, sequenceDiagram, stateDiagram-v2, classDiagram, graph TB/LR)
  - Place diagrams INLINE next to the relevant section text, not in a separate appendix
  - Diagrams must accurately reflect the actual system architecture, data flow, and component relationships described in the document
- NEVER fabricate or assume information not present in the Jira tickets. If data is missing, state it clearly.
- Always cite the source ticket key when listing requirements or details.
- If API calls fail, inform the user and suggest manual steps.
- Create the output directory `documents/{TICKET-KEY}/` if it does not exist.
- Use `stream_write_file` (MCP tool, mode="write" then "append") for creating large markdown files — writes directly to disk, no RAM buffering. **⛔ NEVER use fsWrite/fsAppend for documents > 50 lines.**
- Be thorough but concise — documents should be actionable, not verbose.
- For User Stories, always use the format: "As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- Include UI specifications in table format when screen/interface details are available.
- Include data field specifications in table format when data structures are mentioned.
- Always include validation rules and error handling when business logic is described.
- FSD must be traceable to BRD — every functional spec must reference its source BRD requirement.
- Embed diagram PNGs directly in documents using `![name](diagrams/file.png)` syntax.

## CRITICAL: Diagram Embedding Rules

**Every diagram that is generated as a `.drawio` file MUST also be embedded as a PNG image in the corresponding document (BRD or FSD).** If you create a drawio file but don't add `![...](diagrams/....png)` in the markdown, the diagram is wasted.

**Additionally, every `.drawio` file MUST have a link reference in the markdown** so readers know where the editable source is:
```markdown
![Business Flow](diagrams/business-flow.png)
*[Edit in draw.io](diagrams/business-flow.drawio)*
```

**And every `.drawio` file MUST be ingested into KB** so AI agents can read diagram structure:
```
the discovered KB "ingest" tool (
  title: "{TICKET-KEY} Diagram — {diagram-name}",
  content: <full .drawio XML content>,
  tags: "drawio, diagram, {diagram-type}, {TICKET-KEY}, {PROJECT-KEY}"
)
```

### BRD must embed these diagrams:

| System Context Diagram | Section 2.1 System Context | `![System Context](diagrams/system-context.png)` |
| ER Diagram | Section 4.1 Entity Relationship Diagram | `![ER Diagram](diagrams/er-diagram.png)` |
| Activity Diagrams | Section 6 Processing Logic | `![Activity - {name}](diagrams/activity-{name}.png)` |

| Sequence Diagrams | Inside each Use Case in Section 3 | `![Sequence - {use-case}](diagrams/sequence-{id}.png)` |

### Verification Rule

After generating BRD.md or FSD.md, count the number of `![` image references in the document and compare with the number of `.drawio` files created. **Every `.drawio` file must have a corresponding `![...](diagrams/....png)` reference in at least one document (BRD or FSD).** If any diagram is missing from the documents, add the reference before proceeding to export.
